# Donkzz
Advanced Dank Memer self-bot! Supports slash commands, incredibly strong, reliable and easy to use.

# Instructions
  1. Fill the information in config.json and tokens.txt, as in the file.
  2. Run the bot and have it ready for you.

# Credits
  1. This bot is forked, and rewritten from TahaGorme/slashy. Give them some credit.
  2. Also, this bot has been added many functions from the old version, like supporting work minigames, auto-join global DMC giveaways, auto scratch, and support webhooks!
  3. For Replit hosting and custom website, as I'm not good at doing HTML stuff (with the outdated website from the original version) and Replit only supports up to NodeJS v18, Donkzz can't be hosted on Replits, as it can cause RAM overloads and big lag spikes. Since then, I've removed the website and made it self-hosting only. Will have more changes in the future.
  4. Instructions can be found in the repository of the original one (Slashy). Thanks for taking a look on this.
  5. Support server (I need help from coding :D ): https://discord.gg/VS6QSfpjYX. Enjoy!
